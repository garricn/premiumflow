# Agent Guidelines

## Signatures

- **Scope**: Sign PR reviews, issue comments, and automated PR/thread notes. Do not include the signature in PR or issue titles.
- **Signature format**: `— [Your Name]` (ALWAYS use this exact format)
- **Commit footer**: `Signed-off-by: [Your Name]` (when committing via automation)
- **Identity**: If you are Codex, sign as Codex. If you are Cursor, sign as Cursor.
